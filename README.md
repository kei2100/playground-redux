### Three Principles

#### Single Source of truth

The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.

#### State is read-only

The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.

#### Changes are made with pure functions

To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.
